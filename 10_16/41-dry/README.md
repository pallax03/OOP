# Improving an existing design with inheritance

Look at `SimpleBankAccount` and `StrictBankAccount`.

1. Create a new class `ExtendedStrictBankAccount` that extends `SimpleBankAccount`,
  with the same behavior of `StrictBankAccount` (provided by us).
  Your goal is to reduce, as much as possible, code duplications.
  *Note:* modifying `BankAccount`, `AccountHolder`, or `SimpleBankAccount` is *forbidden*.

2. Change the type of the class created in `TestBankAccount` and use it to test your implementation

3. Answer the following question:

We used inheritance in order to improve a sub-optimal design (of course it was sub-optimal, we didn't know inheritance existed!).
How would you have designed the application,
if you knew interfaces and and inheritance?
